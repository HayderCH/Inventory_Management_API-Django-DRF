## README Content for Inventory Management & User Authentication System

This README describes a comprehensive Django-based application that combines robust inventory management with a secure, enterprise-grade user authentication and management system. The project leverages Django REST Framework (DRF) and JWT authentication to deliver scalable, secure, and auditable operations for modern organizations.

---

**Overview**

This application provides:

- Full-featured inventory management supporting products, suppliers, orders, multi-location stock, adjustments, and transfers.
- A secure JWT-based authentication and user management system with role-based access control (RBAC), advanced account security, and a complete automated testing suite.

---

## Features

**Inventory Management**

- Product, supplier, and category management
- Multi-location stock tracking
- Order creation, approval, and fulfillment
- Stock adjustments (receipts, removals, corrections, audits, transfers, losses)
- Stock transfers with approval workflow
- Audit logging for all create, update, and delete actions

**User Management & Authentication**

- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens[2][3]
- Secure token refresh and blacklisting for logout and session management[2][3]
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- User registration with email verification
- Role-based authorization (Admin, Manager, Employee, Auditor)
- User profile management
- Password management with reset flow
- Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- IP address tracking and login attempt logging
- CSRF protection and secure token validation
- Strong password validation

**Testing**

- **All features, endpoints, and security flows are fully covered by automated tests.**

| OrderProduct      | Products per order, quantity, unit price                                                                |
| StockLevel        | Per-location inventory                                                                                  |
| StockAdjustment   | Inventory changes (receive, remove, correct, audit, transfer, loss) with user and reason logging        |
| StockTransfer     | Inter-location transfers with status and approval workflow                                               |

## API Serialization Approach

- **Write Operations:** Use detailed nested serializers for efficient creation and updates of related objects.
- **Read Operations:** Use short or nested serializers for optimized, concise data retrieval.

---

## Authentication Flow (JWT)

- Users log in via `/api/token/` with credentials; receive access and refresh tokens[2][3].
- Access token is sent with every API request in the `Authorization: Bearer ` header[3].
- If the access token expires, the refresh token is used at `/api/token/refresh/` to obtain a new access token[3].
- Token blacklisting ensures secure logout and session invalidation[2].
- Rate limiting and account lockout protect against brute force attacks.
- All authentication and authorization logic is fully tested.

---

## Security Highlights

- All sensitive actions require authentication and appropriate user roles.
- Passwords are validated for strength and never stored in plain text.
- Email verification is required for registration.
- Account lockout and rate limiting are enforced for failed login attempts.
- All tokens are securely generated, validated, and blacklisted on logout.
- IP address and login attempts are logged for auditing.
- CSRF protection is enforced for all relevant endpoints.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Apply migrations**
   - `python manage.py migrate`
4. **Create a superuser**
   - `python manage.py createsuperuser`
5. **Run the development server**
   - `python manage.py runserver`

---

## Usage

- Access the admin panel at `/admin/` for full CRUD operations.
- Use the REST API endpoints for integration, authentication, and inventory operations.
- All endpoints are protected by JWT authentication and RBAC.

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- Models and serializers are designed for easy extension.
- Audit logging and stock adjustment types can be expanded as needed.
- User roles and permissions can be customized for your organization.

---

## Testing

**All features and security flows are fully covered by automated tests.**  
Run tests with:

```
python manage.py test
```
