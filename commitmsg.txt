refactor(api): improve Order and OrderProduct ViewSets with DRF best practices, audit logging, and optimized queries

- Refactored OrderViewSet and OrderProductViewSet for full DRF compliance:
  - Switched to the correct `perform_destroy` method for deletion, using Django's `.delete()`
  - Ensured audit logging uses detail serializers for create, update, and delete actions, capturing the full object state
  - Enhanced queryset methods with `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for efficient N+1-safe lookups
  - Implemented clear action-based permissions for all CRUD operations across roles (admin, manager, employee, auditor)
  - Maintained separation of serializers for list, detail, and write actions for each ViewSet
  - Aligned code style for clarity and maintainability
- Overall, elevated the API's robustness, traceability, and performance for enterprise use
