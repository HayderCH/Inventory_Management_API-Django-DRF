feat(location): add database indexes to city and country fields and composite index for city+country

- Added db_index=True to city and country fields in the Location model for efficient filtering and searching on these fields.
- Introduced a composite index on (city, country) via Meta.indexes for faster multi-field queries (e.g., filtering by both city and country together).
- Ensured alignment with viewset filters and enterprise API performance best practices.
