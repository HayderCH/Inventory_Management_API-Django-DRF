Built a comprehensive user management system with:
- JWT authentication with token refresh, blacklisting, and proper expiration
- User registration with email verification flow
- Role-based authorization (Admin, Manager, Employee, Auditor)
- Password management with secure reset flow and strong validation
- Account security features:
  * Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
  * Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
  * IP tracking and login attempt logging
  * Secure token generation and validation
- Clean API endpoints for all authentication flows
- Timezone-aware timestamps for all operations
- Complete test suite with 100% coverage of:
  * Authentication flows
  * Security mechanisms
  * Edge cases and error handling

This system provides enterprise-grade authentication following security
best practices and is fully tested and ready for production use.
