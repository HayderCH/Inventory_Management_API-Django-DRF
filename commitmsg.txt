Create serializers subdirectory and add modular serializer files for inventory app

- Organized all serializers into a new `serializers` subdirectory within the inventory app
- Split serializers into logical files: product, supplier, location, order, order_product, product_supplier, stock_level, stock_adjustment, stock_transfer, audit_log, and supporting short serializers
- Added/updated `__init__.py` to facilitate clean imports
- Improved maintainability and code organization
