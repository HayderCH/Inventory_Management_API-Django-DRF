Implement enterprise-grade stock transfer, stock level, and stock adjustment features

- Enhanced models in `inventory/models.py` for robust inventory management, including StockTransfer, StockLevel, StockAdjustment, and their related entities.
- Refactored and expanded `inventory/serializers.py` with list, detail, and write serializers for StockTransfer, StockLevel, and StockAdjustment, featuring field-level validation and DRF best practices.
- Added `inventory/views/stock.py`:
  - Full-featured ViewSets for StockTransfer, StockLevel, and StockAdjustment.
  - Filtering, searching, and ordering support across all resources.
  - Role-based permission handling (Admin, Manager, Employee, Auditor) for all inventory operations.
  - Audit logging for create, update, and delete actions.
  - Transaction atomicity and queryset optimizations.
  - Consistent serializer/view logic for maintainability and scalability.
