Implement ProductViewSet with enterprise-grade features and robust audit logging

Summary:
--------
- Added ProductViewSet with role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Employee, Auditor).
- Integrated multiple serializers for list, detail, and write operations.
- Optimized queryset with supplier prefetching for performance on list/retrieve.
- Added filtering, search, and ordering support for large-scale usability:
    - Filter by category, suppliers, price.
    - Search by name, SKU, description.
    - Order by name, price, created_at.
- Included audit logging on create, update, and delete actions using the AuditLog model for traceability and compliance.

Next steps:
-----------
- Extend the same patterns to Supplier, Order, and Stock-related ViewSets.
- Register AuditLog in Django admin for easier audit trail review.
- Add automated tests for permissions and audit logging.
- Confirm pagination settings in REST_FRAMEWORK and test API responses.
